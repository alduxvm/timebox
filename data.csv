2015-09-27T15:00:00;BBC SSO: Mahler 10;Mahler's ultimately peaceful Symphony No 10 was left unfinished at his death, but it was completed with great sensitivity by the musicologist Deryck Cooke, who was keen that the composer's last testament not be thought to be the awesomely downbeat Symphony No 9. It's presented here with Glazunov's Violin Concerto, featuring soloist James Ehnes. And so Donald Runnicles begins his final season as the BBC SSO's Chief Conductor.;http://www.bbc.co.uk/bbcsso

2016-05-20T19:30:00;RSNO: Oundjian conducts Shostakovich Eight;Shostakovich's monumentally bleak Symphony No 8 so failed to hit the appropriate note of mindless optimism that was expected of WW II-era Soviet art that the Soviet authorities rather desperately subtitled it 'the Stalingrad Symphony' and claimed it was a memorial to heroic dead this failed to convince even them, and it ended up being effectively banned. One of those who criticised it was Prokofiev, whose Piano Concerto No 2 is performed here by Nikolai Lugansky. Peter Oundjian conducts.;http://www.rsno.org.uk/

2015-10-15T19:30:00;Scottish Chamber Orchestra: Brahms Symphony No 2;Having spent 15 years writing his Symphony No 1, Brahms wrote his second symphony over the course of a single summer, which goes some way to explain its upbeat mood.
